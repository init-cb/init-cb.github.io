<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Biomedical Engineering at Fuwai Hospital, Peking Union Medical College (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences), under the supervision of Prof. Minjie Lu.

My research interests focus on computer vision, vision-language alignment, Multimodal Large Language Model, and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) artificial intelligence applications. And my current project focuses on visual language alignment in **cardiac MRI** and **clinical report**, including **visual question answering** and **MRI report generation**.

Previously, I obtained my master’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from the First Clinical Medical College(Xuanwu Hospital), Capital Medical University, supervised by Prof. Jie Lu. I did some research about **atherosclerosis** in the **carotid MRI** and brain during this stage.

I have published some papers about these topics with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dolRmMkAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
