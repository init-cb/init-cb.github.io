<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Biomedical Engineering at Fuwai Hospital, Peking Union Medical College (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences), under the supervision of Prof. Minjie Lu. Previously, I obtained my master’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from the First Clinical Medical College(Xuanwu Hospital), Capital Medical University, supervised by Prof. Jie Lu. 

My research interests focus on computer vision, vision-language alignment, and magnetic resonance imaging artificial intelligence applications. I have published some papers about these topics with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dolRmMkAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dolRmMkAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
